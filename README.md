## Francisco Sabino - Personal Portfolio

- This page was designed with the purpose of attacting job opportunities. It is part of my milestones 2 (MLS 2) for my developer course at the Code Institute. The main idea with this page is to make it a hub for my future projects and work, so recruiters and potential employers can easily reach out.

## UX

- I have designed the UX in a intuitive way whereas visitors can easily find what they are looking for. The purpose of the design is provide feedback to the guests so they dont feel lost when navigating through the landing page.

- The Landing Page was divided in several sections that are easy to be navigated thanks to a dynamic sticky navigation that follows the user up and down the page.

### Colour Scheme and Imagery

- The colours chosen for the page were mainly black and white to bring the depth and drama on the imagery, with a touch of gold ish on links and buttons.

### Typhography

- The font I have chosen for the page is Questrial. It was downloaded from Google Fonts. It gives the page a modern and classy look.

## Technologies Used

### Languages

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

### Frameworks and Libraries

[Bootstrap v5.0.0 :](https://getbootstrap.com/)

- Bootstrap was used to assist with the responsiveness and styling of the website.

[Hover.css:](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)

- Hover.css was used on the Social Media icon.

[Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/)

- Google fonts were used to import the 'Questrial' font into the style.css file which is used on the project.

[Font Awesome:](https://fontawesome.com/)

- Font Awesome throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.

[GitHub:](https://github.com/)

- GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from VScode.

#### Wireframing

I have used [Figma](https://figma.com/) for as a prototyping tool. Figma is very intuitive and easy to use. The program gives you a great look on how the page will come to look like as well as page connections that demonstrate the way the page should behave.
