# Project Portfolio MLS 2

## Francisco Sabino - Personal Portfolio

This page was designed with the purpose of attacting job opportunities. It is part of my milestones 2 (MLS 2) for my developer course at the Code Institute. The main idea with this page is to make it a hub for my future projects and work, so recruiters and potential employers can easily reach out.

## UX

I have designed the UX in a intuitive way whereas visitors can easily find what they are looking for. The purpose of the design is provide feedback to the guests so they dont feel lost when navigating through the landing page.

## Design

### Colour Scheme and Imagery

The colours chosen for the page were mainly black and white to bring the depth and drama on the imagery, with a touch of gold ish on links and buttons.

### Typhography

The font I have chosen for the page is Questrial. It was downloaded from Google Fonts. It gives the page a modern and classy look.
