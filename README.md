## Francisco Sabino - Personal Portfolio

- This page was designed with the purpose of attacting job opportunities. It is part of my milestone 2 (MLS 2) for my developer course at the Code Institute. The main idea with this page is to make it a hub for my future projects and work, so recruiters and potential employers can easily reach out.

## User Experience (UX)

### Visitors can

- Submit a form directly from the website's contact form at the bottom of the page. The form is validated using Javascript, and sent using EmailJS. Once that is completed they receive an alert message letting them know their message has been sent sucessfully.

- Have access to Milestones, future and current projects.

#### First Time Visitor Goals

1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the page and navigate to the information needed.
2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for modern UX and a not very home page where an user gets constant feedback of their position on the page.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find more information about milestones and development.
2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find updated projects section and more information about current developments.

## Design

### Colour Scheme and Imagery

- The colours chosen for the page were mainly black and white to bring the depth and drama on the imagery, with a touch of Light vibrant green on links and buttons to bring out the contrast to the eye.

Color Palette

### Typhography

- The font I have chosen for the page is Questrial. It was downloaded from Google Fonts. It gives the page a modern and classy look.

- ### Imagery

- Imagery plays a big role on the page. The large, background hero image brigs depth and catch the visitors eye.

### Wireframing

I have used [Figma](https://figma.com/) for as a prototyping tool. Figma is very intuitive and easy to use. The program gives you a great look on how the page will come to look like as well as page connections that demonstrate the way the page should behave.
